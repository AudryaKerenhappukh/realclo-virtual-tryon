Absolutely 💪 — here’s a **clean, professional README** for your RealClo repo that explains what it does, how to install it, and how to run it locally or deploy it. It’s written to fit your current Streamlit + modular structure.

## 🪄 **RealClo: AI-Powered Virtual Try-On**

RealClo offers a new and scalable approach to online fashion retail by allowing customers to **see how clothing realistically looks on their own body or an AI-generated avatar** before purchasing.
The platform bridges the gap between physical and digital shopping by improving **fit confidence**, reducing **product returns**, and enhancing **inclusivity** in fashion e-commerce.

---

### 🌐 **Overview**

RealClo provides two main interactive modes:

1. **👕 Photo Fit** – Upload or select a model photo to visualize how a garment fits.
2. **🧍 Build Avatar** – Generate an AI avatar based on your measurements and skin tone, then try clothes virtually.

The app uses an external API (KlingAI) for generating avatars and performing virtual try-ons.

### ⚙️ **Installation**

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/realclo.git
cd realclo
```

#### 2. Set up a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows
```

#### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🔐 **Authentication Setup**

RealClo connects to the **KlingAI API** for image generation and virtual try-on.

In your environment, set your API key or secret as an environment variable:

Perfect — that clarifies things 🔐

So your app uses **ACCESS_KEY** and **SECRET_KEY** (not a simple API key) to authenticate with KlingAI.
That means you’re generating a **JWT** using those two credentials — the **ACCESS_KEY** identifies your account, and the **SECRET_KEY** signs the token.

Let’s update your **README** to reflect that properly, so anyone setting it up knows exactly how to configure the credentials.

### ⚙️ **Installation**

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/realclo.git
cd realclo
```

#### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv

### 🔐 **Authentication Setup**

RealClo requires two environment variables for KlingAI API access:

| Variable     | Description                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `ACCESS_KEY` | Your KlingAI access key (public identifier)    |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Your KlingAI secret key (used to sign the JWT) |

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add:

```bash
ACCESS_KEY="your_access_key_here"
SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key_here"
```

Or set them directly in your shell:

```bash
export ACCESS_KEY="your_access_key_here"
export SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key_here"
```

---


### 🚀 **Run the App**

Once everything is set up, launch RealClo:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start a local server, typically at:
👉 [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)
